		Sixth Form is hectic ok? Cut me some slack!<br/><br />
		I've been hard at work though, and I've moved on in terms of the projects I'm working on, I'll do seperate posts in detail, but here's a summary:<br/>
	  I've more or less finished the "Game Engine" for my platformer. I just need to skin it and design the levels.<br/>
	  I've added 2 more games! One, Hex Color/Color Difference was a personal challenge, and I did it in under 2 hours. The other, "Your Smol Bean" is a virtual pet that I hope to finish Soon&trade;<br/>
	  I've added a <a href="/physics">Physics and Other Nerdy Stuff Section</a>! Little experiments and toys will go there! I've already added two, with one awaiting bug fixes!<br />
	  I've cleaned out the repo too, so there should be less useless files lying around<br/>
	  I've also helped design the website for my schools magazine, <a href="//backchat.kefw.org">BackChat</a>, its my first work for a third part, and frankly I've very pleased with it and myself</a>
	  I've also updated the layout and copy on the main site, so it should look a little more inviting!
		<br /> <br/>
		Sorry for the hiatus! I'll try to post as much as I can!<br>
		All of the artwork and photography for this blog and throught my site are from <a href="//unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>, who offer free to use high resolution images. I love their artwork and highly recommend it to any developer.
