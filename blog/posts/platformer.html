	<h1>Development on my Platformer!</h1>
	<h2>By Deep Sohelia, 1st May 2016</h2>
	<p>
		I've coded all but the Bosses for my game, and I'm starting the level design for my game, something which takes much more effort than I initially thought it would.<br/>
		I will be releasing the first two worlds, unskinned, when the first two bosses are done, as a demo.<br>
		Then, once all the levels are finished and skinned, I will release the game, either on my website here, or if possible, on a website such as GOG.com.<br>
		You can see the live in-development version <a href="/GameDev/platformer/">Here</a><br/>
		All of the artwork and photography for this blog and throught my site are from <a href="//unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>, who offer free to use high resolution images. I love their artwork and highly recommend it to any developer.
