	<h1>Which platform should I be streaming on?</h1>

		This will be a longer post analyzing these three streaming platforms: YouTube Gaming, Twitch and WatchBeam, or Beam. 
		<br /><br />
		Playing video games is a very common past-time, and when you can share your gaming experiences with friends and grow your channel doing so, streaming seems a very attractive concept. There is no tedious editing or preparation associated with a stream. It is (almost) a one-time set up, and can be started with just the push of a button, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jom9iUgom_w" target="_blank">OMGChad knows all too well.</a> 
    <br /><br />
    When one goes to stream, however, a big decision that they are immediately faced with is this: "Do I stream to YouTube, Beam, or Twitch". Everybody tends to pick a platform that they were recommended, or the one they prefer to be a viewer on, and then give little thought to the decision afterward. (Yes, I am generalizing. Many give this decision lots of thought.)
		<br /><br />
		<span class="h3">But which should they choose?</span>
		<br /><br />
		Everyone seems to be using Twitch, its well known and many people trust it. You can be partnered, and you can make money from your streams! Due to this, many people, such as <a href="//twitch.tv/mktheworst/profile">Twitch</a> stream exclusively to Twitch.
		<br /><br />
		MK is a good friend and a streamer whose content never ceases to entertain or cause excessive gigglefits. Check her out on

		<a href="//twitter.com/mktheworst">Twitter</a>, 
		<a href="//twitch.tv/mktheworst/profile">Twitch</a>, and 
		<a href="//instagram.com/mktheworst">Instagram</a>.
		Tell her I sent you, and give her plenty of &lt;3
		<br /><br />
		MK streams exclusively to Twitch, and for good reason. She has a large following, 17671 followers as of 15/07/15. She has also been a member of the Twitch Partner program for over a year, and has amassed over 100 subscribers. As such, streaming on Beam or YouTube would provide more disadvantages over advantages. Twitch is tried and tested: Their servers are built to capacitate thousands of people watching her stream, and it is incredibly easy to set up a stream.  Their is a large support network, and an even larger community of the platform. 
		<br /><br />
		This large community has allowed MK, and countless other streamers to become larger and to grow the channel, through Twitch raids. A raid is when a streamer, once their stream ends, sends their viewers to another, usually smaller streamer. This works as a sort of "trickle-down" system, with people joining the platform to watch bigger streamers, but finding their way down either through raids or through the Twitch platform. YouTube Gaming or Beam come nowhere near close to being able to match this growing power, allowing streamers to gain 17,000 followers in a year or two. 
		<br /><br />
		However, beside this community, Twitch is quite average. The stream quality isn't adjustable unless partnered, and the stream delay is still quite high, around 1 minute - 30 seconds. The twitch support team can be slow to respond at times, and spam and viewbotting (When silly people make hundreds of computers connect to the stream in a bid to take it offline) is common.
