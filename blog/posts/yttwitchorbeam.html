	<h1>Which platform should I be streaming on?</h1>
	<h2>By Deep Sohelia, 15th August 2015</h2>

		This will be a longer post analyzing these three streaming platforms: YouTube Gaming, Twitch and Beam. 
		<br /><br />
		Playing video games is a very common past-time, and when you can share your gaming experiences with friends and grow your channel doing so, streaming seems a very attractive concept. There is no tedious editing or preparation associated with a stream. It is (almost) a one-time set up, and can be started with just the push of a button, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jom9iUgom_w" target="_blank">OMGChad knows all too well.</a> 
    <br /><br />
    When one goes to stream, however, a big decision that they are immediately faced with is this: "Do I stream to YouTube, Beam, or Twitch". Everybody tends to pick a platform that they were recommended, or the one they prefer to be a viewer on, and then give little thought to the decision afterward. (Yes, I am generalizing. Many give this decision lots of thought.)
		<br /><br />
		<span class="h3">But which should they choose?</span>
		<br /><br />
		Everyone seems to be using Twitch, its well known and many people trust it. You can be partnered, and you can make money from your streams! Due to this, many people, such as <a href="//twitch.tv/mktheworst/profile">MKtheWorst</a> stream exclusively to Twitch.
		<br /><br />
		MK is a good friend and a streamer whose content never ceases to entertain or cause excessive gigglefits. Check her out on 
		<a href="//youtube.com/user/mktheworst">Youtube</a>, 
		<a href="//twitter.com/mktheworst">Twitter</a>, 
		<a href="//twitch.tv/mktheworst/profile">Twitch</a>, and 
		<a href="//instagram.com/mktheworst">Instagram</a>.
		Tell her I sent you, and give her plenty of &lt;3<br />
		(If this is the first you're hearing of her tweet me and her saying "Fishybits rule, down with chickenbits!", and say no more about it!)  
		<br /><br />
		MK streams exclusively to Twitch, and for good reason. She has a large following, 17671 followers as of 15/08/15. She has also been a member of the Twitch Partner program for over a year, and has amassed over 100 subscribers. As such, streaming on Beam or YouTube would provide more disadvantages over advantages. Twitch is tried and tested: Their servers are built to capacitate thousands of people watching her stream, and it is incredibly easy to set up a stream.  Their is a large support network, and an even larger community of the platform. 
		<br /><br />
		This large community has allowed MK, and countless other streamers to become larger and to grow the channel, through Twitch raids. A raid is when a streamer, once their stream ends, sends their viewers to another, usually smaller streamer. This works as a sort of "trickle-down" system, with people joining the platform to watch bigger streamers, but finding their way down either through raids or through the Twitch platform. YouTube Gaming or Beam come nowhere near close to being able to match this growing power, allowing streamers like MK to gain as many as 17,000 followers in a year or two. 
		<br /><br />
		However, beside this community, Twitch is quite average. The stream quality isn't adjustable unless partnered, and the stream delay is still quite high, around 1 minute - 30 seconds. The twitch support team can be slow to respond at times, and spam and viewbotting (When silly people make hundreds of computers connect to the stream in a bid to take it offline) is common.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="h3">Alright, how about <a href="//beam.pro">Beam?</a></span>
		<br /><br />
		Beam is almost the exact opposite of Twitch: It is a small platform, with the largest streamer having 1,426 followers. Granted, this is a HUGE number, the equivalent of my entire school, but this is less than 1% of MK's follower count. Due to this small community, everyone already knows most streamers, and so growth beyond the first 100 is very limited.
		<br /><br />
		However, despite the lack of a large community, Beam outshines all the other platforms with its features and its customer support. Unlike Twitch, Beam has a much more user-friendly interface, with a futuristic design and its jaw-dropping stream delay: Often less than 2 seconds. This works wonders for the viewers and for interaction, because no longer are you waiting for a reply. No longer do you have to remember what you said 2 minutes ago. The responses are almost instantaneous.  Twitch nor YouTube come close to Beam in this regard.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="h3">You forgot <a href="//youtube.com">YouTube Gaming!</a></span>
		<br /><br />
		No I didn't, don't you worry! YouTube/Google/Alphabet/Whatever You wanna call them announced YouTube Gaming, a way to stream to YouTube, much like Twitch or Beam. While it is still in its infancy, it has been used for a variety of purposes. "An evening with Top Gear", a BBC program, was broadcast to YouTube live, and other streamers have dedicated their game livestreaming to this platform. Streamers such as <a href="//youtube.com/user/Brhys1">Brhys1</a>
		<br /><br />
		B is a good friend of mine, and he is an awesome streamer! There's never a dull moment with him, and he cares immensly for his viewers! Please check him out on:
		<a href="//youtube.com/user/brhys1">Youtube</a>, 
		<a href="//twitter.com/brhysh">Twitter</a>, and 
		<a href="//instagram.com/brhysh">Instagram</a>.
		Tell him I sent you, and give him lots of maple syru-*cough* Er, I mean &lt;3! <br/>
		<!--(If this is the first you're hearing of him, Tweet at me and him saying "I love steamed broccoli!" and never speak of it again!)
		--><br /><br />
		B's main reason for using YouTube streaming, and its key advantage, is that all of your subscribers can see that you are streaming, and they do not need another account to join, meaning that more users can and will take part, and the maths reflects this. (Yes, Maths with an S.)<br/>
		B's last stream (as of 15/08/2015) peaked at around 35 viewers simultaneously, and B has exactly 1,100 subs at the time of writing. <br/>
		This gives us a stream viewership of 7/220. This isn't a nice number, so lets approximate the above values. <br/>
		30 divided by 1000 is 3/100ths, or 3%, a nicer number to work with. 3% of Brhys1's viewers turned up to B's livestream. <br />
		This seems a small number, but you'd be surprised. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
		<br/><br/>
		Maybe that number is so small because of how new YouTube Gaming is. Twitch should blow it out of the water, right? Nope. <br />
		MK has a jaw-dropping 17,761 follow count, and her average viewer count, as estimated by <a href="https://twitter.com/MKtheWorst/status/632421688940998656">MK herself</a>, is 90. <br />
		Rounding the follow count up to 18000, 90 divided by 18000 gives us 1/200, or half a percent. 
		<br/><br/>
		Thats six times less than YouTube gaming. Comparing against YouTube subs just lowers this number further.
		<br /><br />
		"Fine, how about beam?" I hear you cry. Same story.
		I will keep the streamer anonymous here. <br>
		Streamer X streams regularly to Beam, and has gained a following of 440 people on Beam, considerably large for the platform.<br>
		On an average stream Streamer X has 6 viewers in chat. <br />
		This gives us 3/220, 4/220 less than YouTube Gaming, but minutely bigger than Twitch, though this is likely a rounding artifact.<br />
		That should make it more than clear. If you want all your viewers, your fans, to watch your stream, you should stream to YouTube Gaming. The numbers show it clearly.
		<br /><br />
		<span class="h3">Conclusion</span>
		The platform you choose should reflect what you want to get out of streaming. <br>
		If you wish to be part of the wider streaming community and to potentially make an income of of Streaming, then Twitch is definetely your best bet. You will compromise on strean delay and some funtionality, however.<br>
		If viewer experience, integration and superior customer service is what you're after, then Beam is your by far your best bet: The staff are always available and helpful, the stream delay is almost non existant, and more features are being added daily.<br/>
		If viewer participation is key for you, then choose YouTube. It can be streamed to from any PC with an internet connection, (Literally.) and is accessible by all of your YouTube subscribers, meaning that nobody is left behind, unaware of the fact that you live stream.<br>
		<br /><br />
		Pick the streaming platform that best fits what you want. Over and out.
