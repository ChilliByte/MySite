	<h1>Which platform should I be streaming on?</h1>

		This will be a longer post analyzing these three streaming platforms: YouTube Gaming, Twitch and WatchBeam, or Beam.

		Playing video games is a very common past-time, and when you can share your gaming experiences with friends and grow your channel doing so, streaming seems a very attractive concept. There is no tedious editing or preparation associated with a stream. It is (almost) a one-time set up, and can be started with just the push of a button, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jom9iUgom_w" target="_blank">OMGChad knows all too well.</a> 
    <br /><br />
    When one goes to stream, however, a big decision that they are immediately faced with is this: "Do I stream to YouTube, Beam, or Twitch". Everybody tends to pick a platform that they were recommended, or the one they prefer to be a viewer on, and then give little thought to the decision afterward. (Yes, I am generalizing. Many give this decision lots of thought.)

		But which should they choose?
