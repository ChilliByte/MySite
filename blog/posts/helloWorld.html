	<h1>Hello World!</h1>

		This is my first post! I have just finished writing the code for the blog! <br />
		This Blog will be updated monthly if not weekly, with updates on the progress of the multiple projects I am working on, along with other geeky trivia. This was entirely created by me, both the template and the post loading system. The only exception being the use of AHAH, or Asyncronous HTML and HTTP, a small (8 lines or so) script which is used to fetch the feeds. There is no jQuery involved. The system works by storing the file names of all posts that are to be loaded in an array, and then looping through the array, loading in each post. While not the most elegant of solutions, it is the lightest in terms of SLOC. It means I can use as <strong>much fancy markup</strong> as I want, making it my far the most lightweight and customizable way for me to make blog posts. The template is downloadable over <a href="/templates">here</a>, but there is a cost for the post system.

		All of the artwork and photography for this blog and throught my site are from <a href="//unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>, who offer free to use high resolution images. I love their artwork and highly recommend it to any developer.
