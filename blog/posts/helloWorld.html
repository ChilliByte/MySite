	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<h2>By Deep Sohelia, 30th July 2015</h2>

		This is my first post! I have just finished writing the code for the blog! This was entirely created by me, the only exception being the use of AHAH, or Asyncronous HTML and HTTP, which is used to fetch the feeds. There is no jQuery involved. The system works by storing the file names of all posts that are to be loaded in an array, and then looping through the array, loading in each post. While no the most elegant of solutions, it is the lightest in terms of SLOC. This Blog will be updated monthly if not weekly, with updates on the progress of the multiple projects I am working on.
		
		All of the artwork and photography for this blog and throught my site are from <a href="//unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>, who offer free to use high resolution images. I love their artwork and highly recommend it to any developer.
