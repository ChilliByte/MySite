#Youtube Stream Chat Commands

Here is the bookmarklet code for the bot:

javascript:(function()%7Bfunction%20callback()%7Bconsole.log(%22Bot%20code%20loaded!%22)%7Dvar%20s%3Ddocument.createElement(%22script%22)%3Bs.src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fchillibyte.github.io%2Fbot%2Fbrhysh.js%22%3Bif(s.addEventListener)%7Bs.addEventListener(%22load%22%2Ccallback%2Cfalse)%7Delse%20if(s.readyState)%7Bs.onreadystatechange%3Dcallback%7Ddocument.body.appendChild(s)%3B%7D)()

You want to create a new bookmark, but instead of a URL, you want to use the above code. This will run some Javascript and enable you to use commands.
Please note that this is client side code, and you need to run the bookmarklet to be able to use the commands.

If you want commands for your channel, use the contact form at chillibyte.github.io and request one.
