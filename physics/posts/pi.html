<h1>Pi Art</h1>
<h2>By Deep Sohelia, 14th March 2016</h2>
<p>
This is a piece of Pi-inspired art.<br/>
The art is composed of a square grid of varying colored pixels, with seemingly random plaes dots of different colors<br/>
The distance between these different colored dots represent each of the digits of pi!<br/>
The color of the dots depend on their position along with the time they have bee visible for.<br/>
Happy Pi Day!
