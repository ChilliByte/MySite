<h1>Ballistics</h1>
<h2>By Deep Sohelia, 10th March 2016</h2>
<p>
This toy allows you to simulate a thrown projectile, with variable power and air resistance.<br/>
Projectile velocity degrades in both the x and y axes, making the tragectory more akin to those seen in the real world, given the correct value of air resistance.<br/>
Projectile color depends on both x and y co-ordinates<br/>
This toy has been integrated into my platformer, which will be released Soon&trade;!
